# CSigner
An application written in Java to work with smartcards to embed signatures on PDF, it is also possible to sign other file formats - in this case the signatures are generated on a distinct file.
This project contains the source code to study case, javadocs and CSigner.exe use and its functions.
- Is important to note, that this project was started to provide an open-source alternative to sign PDF documents with A3 digital certificates based on Brazil's PKI, from ICP-Brasil chain (aka e-CPF and e-CNPJ). A3 digital certificates are stored inside hardware devices, cryptographic tokens or smart cards.
